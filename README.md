# lemonra1n
iOS 15.0 - 15.4.1 (15.5b4) work in progress semi-tethered checkm8 jailbreak

# What does this do?
It boots the device with AMFI patches. There is **no tweak injection yet**.

**NOTE**: Onboard blobs are pretty much needed so you don't get the black screen issue. Dump onboards with [this app](https://appinstallerios.com/TrollStoreIPAs/Blob.ipa), then use that blob with this Jailbreak

**NOTE 2**: This is for macOS only

**NOTE 3**: lemonra1n needs full disk access this can be granted in system preferences

# How to use
1. Install libimobiledevice & libirecovery
2. Install lemonra1n from [here](https://github.com/BenjaminHornbeck6/lemonra1n/releases/download/lemonra1n/lemonra1n.app.zip)
3. Prepare your onboard blob for the **current version** you're on
4. Put your device in DFU mode
6. Open lemonra1n, select your blob then type in your iOS version and tap Jailbreak (should take about 1 minute)
7. Install Pogo through TrollStore, then hit Install in the app!
    - You can get the Pogo IPA from [here](https://nightly.link/elihwyma/Pogo/workflows/build/main/Pogo.zip)
